### [SOFTWARE][1] : **YOCTO PROJECTÂ® COMPATIBLE LAYERS**

Layers support the inclusion of technologies, hardware components, and software components. The Yocto Project Compatible designation provides a minimum level of standardization which contributes to a strong ecosystem. "Yocto Project Compatible" is applied to appropriate products and software components such as BSPs, other OE-compatible layers, and related open-source projects, allowing the producer to use Yocto Project badges and branding assets. Introductory information about layers and the OpenEmbedded Layer Index can be found in the Software Overview Layers Section, or general information can be found in the documentation. If you cannot find your necessary layer here, look in the OpenEmbedded layer index which contains more layers but the content is less universally validated.

Yocto Project member organizations can provide information about specific BSPs. Please visit the Yocto Project Member BSP page for details.
